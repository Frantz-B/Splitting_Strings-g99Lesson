# Splitting_Strings-g99Lesson
Lesson 27

Splitting up strings using a separator (i.e. ";") and selecting splitting a few words out the string 

Also Used ForEach loop to iterate over without using any counters. Traditional for loop (counter, condition and increment), and a more optimized approach that will not use any such counter.

For(<DataType of array/List><Temp variable name>   : <Array/List to be iterated>){
    System.out.println();
//Any other operation can be done with this temp variable.
}
